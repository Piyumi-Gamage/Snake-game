# Snake-game
A simple Snake Game developed using C++, Arduino. Control the snake, eat food to grow longer, and avoid crashing into the walls or yourself! This project helped me practice fundamental concepts like game loops, collision detection, and real-time user interaction.

## Features
- Smooth snake movement
- Random food generation
- Score tracking
- Game Over handling
- Sound effects, multiple difficulty levels.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
- Eat the food to grow longer.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.
- Try to achieve the highest score!
